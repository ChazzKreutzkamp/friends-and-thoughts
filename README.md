# friends-and-thoughts
## Description

This code is the backend to a potential social media website where a user can make friends, post thoughts, and reply to fellow users thoughts. The backend for this project utilizes a NOSQL server, specifically MONGOOSE to achieve this goal. This project contains two models for thoughts and users, that respectively contain information for friends and replies. The code also contains all the crud functions associated with said models, so that someone can start working on their own database if they so desire to download my code and experiment with it for themselves.
